#   * Try to keep it short, snappy and to the point.

It depended on iOSDFULibrary and iOSMcuManagerLibrary,so can support NordicDFU and SMPDFU by BLE. All things BPBleOTA done are aggregating them and provide a unified interfaceï¼ŒSo it can support pure Objective-C projects which are not supported directly by NordicDFU and SMPDFU'
